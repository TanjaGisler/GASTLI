**The GAS gianT modeL for Interiors (GASTLI): An open-source coupled interior-atmosphere model to unveil gas giant composition**

Welcome to the repository of GASTLI, an open-source code for the calculation of interior structure models for gas giants.
GASTLI allows the computation of mass-radius curves, thermal evolution curves, and interior composition retrievals to fit a interior structure model to your mass, radius, age, and if available, atmospheric metallicity data.
